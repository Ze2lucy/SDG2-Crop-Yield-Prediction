# SDG 2: Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger)** by predicting crop yields based on environmental and agricultural data using machine learning.

The goal is to help optimize food production and promote sustainable agriculture.

## Dataset

- Crop production data including features such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide use, crop type, and region.
- Source: Kaggle (link to dataset)

## Machine Learning Approach

- Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding categorical variables, train-test split.
- Models used: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluation metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), RÂ² score.
- Visualizations to compare actual vs predicted yields and residual analysis.
